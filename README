iqraycast - simple offline raycast renderer written for educational purposes
By Leszek Godlewski <lg@inequation.org>

It's SLOW. I mean, really slow. There are no optimizations in place whatsoever
- shape and light lists are simply iterated, there is no broadphase in collision
detection, programming is probably bad OOP and so on. The idea was to quickly draft
up a raytracer in order to grasp the essence of the raytracing algorithm itself.

You have been warned.

Depends on OpenImageIO for image output (now) and texture reading (in the future).
